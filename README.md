The goal of micRo is to easy the handling and export of micro data from health registries and other data bases for researchers.

## Disclosure

I will take no responsibility for the use of these provided tools, as the results should always be thoroughly checked to live up to the export criteria.

Still, thorough testing and documentation including examples are missing. Do not use these functions just yet.


## Installation

You can install the development version of micRo like so:

``` r
require("pak")
pak::pak("agdamsbo/micRo")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(micRo)
```
